What's that ?
=============

This is my little starter kit. I use it when I have to work a a website (so pretty much all the time) as a base to start quickly. It contains several folders, here's what they do :

Code
----

That's the frontend development bit, Html/css/js and all those stuff happen in here.

Design
------

Design happens in there, contains few psd for my color schemer (yep I love color schemes), that's supposed to be imported in the design psd for easier use/modification of the colors.

Also contains several .psd for font testing and grid systems. Those have to be updated as there's the same psd twice or something like that.

Font-Specimens
--------------

Useful for testing fonts in browser to pick the best size and contrasts before designing with Photoshop's _creative_ font rendering engine. No surprises, I know how it'll look in browser before avoiding the "damn it all looks bold in Firefox" moment.

UX (user exerience)
--------------------

Sitemaps, Wireframes, whether I produce them myself or not, I like to have all those things in my project folder so I know where they are when I need them and they're archived with everything else for future reference... Better than looking through my emails or any kind of project management software.

www
---

Used for backend dev, I put all the files in there and point a local URL to there so, once again, all the code is at the same place.
